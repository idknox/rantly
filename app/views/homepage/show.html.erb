    <p>"Rantly has allowed a certain freedom I never thought possible.
      Now I can rant to the internet at large, without having to worry
      about my thoughts. I just type it out, hit click, and feel
      the surge of relief. Thanks Rantly, you've truly made my most
      inane rants heard. I remember a time when I was able to truly express
      myself. It's really frustrating when you want to be heard and no one..."</p>
